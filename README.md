# Handcuffs
**Addon for Garry's Mod.**

:white_check_mark: These handcuffs are compatible with all gamemode in Garry's Mod, though the jailer/bailer only work with the DarkRP gamemode.

:white_check_mark: This addon is adapted for DarkRP gamemode.

This is an extension of https://github.com/GuillaumeBenit/Handcuffs, which only contains handcuffs and lockpicks for the handcuffs.
I've appended the functionality for a jailer such that players can be brought to a station and be arrested there, and a bailer such that you can bail out friends for a sum of money.
I've also added the functionality for dragging handcuffed players
